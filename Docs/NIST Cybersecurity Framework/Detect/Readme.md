# 3. Detect 

The "Detect" function in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is like having a security system on campus. It's about setting up ways to quickly notice when something unusual happens, like an unauthorized person trying to enter a restricted area. This step helps your organization spot potential cyber threats early, so you can respond before any serious damage is done. For a deeper understanding, you can explore further with the [NIST Guide](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/five-functions).

- **Anomaly and Event Detection**: Deploy systems to continuously monitor and detect unusual activities that could indicate a cybersecurity event.
- **Security Continuous Monitoring**: Establish processes for continuous monitoring of cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities.
