## Introduction to NIST Cybersecurity Framework

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides guidelines and best practices to help organizations improve their cybersecurity posture through five key functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

## Identify

### Purpose
Developing an organizational understanding to manage cybersecurity risk to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.

### Key Activities
- **Asset Management**: Cataloging and managing assets (hardware, software, data) throughout their lifecycle.
- **Business Environment Understanding**: Comprehending the organization's mission, objectives, stakeholders, and activities, and how these interplay with cybersecurity risk.
- **Governance**: Establishing clear cybersecurity policies, legal and regulatory requirements, and risk management processes.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing risks.
- **Risk Management Strategy**: Developing strategies to manage risks, aligning with organizational goals and compliance requirements.

## Protect

### Purpose
Developing and implementing safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical services.

### Key Activities
- **Identity Management and Access Control**: Ensuring only authorized individuals can access systems and data.
- **Awareness and Training**: Educating employees about cybersecurity risks and responsibilities.
- **Data Security**: Protecting data at rest, in transit, and in use.
- **Information Protection Processes and Procedures**: Implementing policies and procedures to protect information systems and assets.
- **Protective Technology**: Utilizing technology solutions (firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion detection systems) to protect against threats.

## Detect

### Purpose
Developing and implementing activities to identify cybersecurity events.

### Key Activities
- **Anomalies and Events Detection**: Establishing baselines and monitoring for unusual or unauthorized activity.
- **Security Continuous Monitoring**: Implementing tools and processes for real-time monitoring of cybersecurity threats.
- **Detection Processes**: Developing and refining processes to quickly and accurately detect cybersecurity incidents.

## Respond

### Purpose
Developing and implementing activities to respond to a detected cybersecurity incident.

### Key Activities
- **Response Planning**: Having a coordinated response plan for cybersecurity incidents.
- **Communications**: Managing internal and external communications during and after an incident.
- **Analysis**: Analyzing incidents to determine their impact and scope.
- **Mitigation**: Taking steps to limit the impact of an incident.
- **Improvements**: Modifying response strategies based on lessons learned.

## Recover

### Purpose
Developing and implementing activities to maintain resilience and restore any capabilities impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.

### Key Activities
- **Recovery Planning**: Creating plans to recover from cybersecurity incidents and restore systems and services.
- **Improvements**: Continuously improving recovery strategies and plans based on evolving threats and lessons learned.
- **Communications**: Coordinating with internal stakeholders and external partners to facilitate recovery efforts.
