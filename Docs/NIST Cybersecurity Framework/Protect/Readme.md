# 2. Protect 

The "Protect" function in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is about setting up defenses to keep your organization's digital campus safe. It involves putting in place measures like locks on doors (access controls), teaching everyone safety tips (awareness training), and making sure sensitive information is locked in a safe (data encryption). This step ensures that even if threats come knocking, your organization's valuable assets are well-guarded. For more insights, you might find the [NIST Guide](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/five-functions) helpful.

 - **Access Control**: Implement the least privilege principle and strong authentication methods to control access to assets.
 - **Awareness and Training**: Educate employees about cybersecurity best practices and potential threats.
 - **Data Security**: Ensure data is encrypted both at rest and in transit, and apply data lifecycle management practices.
