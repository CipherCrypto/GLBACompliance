# 5. Recover 

The "Recover" function in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is about getting things back to normal after a cybersecurity incident, similar to repairing and reopening parts of the campus after a storm. It involves fixing what was damaged, learning from what happened, and improving defenses to be better prepared for the next time. This ensures your organization can bounce back and continue its operations with minimal disruption. For more in-depth information, you can refer to the [NIST Guide](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/five-functions).

- **Recovery Planning**: Develop and implement recovery plans to restore any capabilities or services impaired by a cybersecurity incident.
  - **Example**: Implement a disaster recovery plan that includes regular backups and a clear roadmap for restoring systems and data.
- **Improvements**: After an incident, conduct a post-incident review to identify lessons learned and improve recovery strategies and processes.
  - **Example**: Hold a "lessons learned" meeting with all stakeholders involved in the incident response to update plans and procedures based on the incident review.
