# 4 Respond 

The "Respond" function in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is akin to having an emergency plan in place for when incidents occur. It's about knowing exactly what to do, who to call, and how to minimize damage when a cyber threat is detected, similar to a fire drill on campus. This ensures your organization can quickly address and mitigate the impact of a cybersecurity event. For further details, the [NIST Guide](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/online-learning/five-functions) provides more information.

- **Response Planning**: Have a documented incident response plan that outlines roles, responsibilities, and actions to take in the event of a cyber incident.
  - **Example**: Develop an incident response plan using templates from resources like the SANS Institute.
- **Communication**: Define communication protocols for internal and external stakeholders during an incident.
  - **Example**: Create pre-drafted communication templates for various incident scenarios to expedite response time.
